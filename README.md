CSE 151B Kaggle Competition

Hello instructors!

We could not upload our notebooks on GitHub classroom so we decided to make a repo here. Related [piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/lfkmvtc0o1d5tq/post/540).

# How to run our code for the best-performing model
- Please run **[CSE 151B] Final Model [Thy]-final version.ipynb**. You'll just need to run it sequentially from top to bottom. The predictions will be outputed as a csv file (pred.csv). 
- The other files show our EDA, feature engineering steps, and some other experiments.
